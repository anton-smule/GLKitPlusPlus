GLKit++
=============

 GLKit++ is a tiny but suprisingly powerful 3D framework built on top of GLKit.
 It extends GLKit by adding the following capabilites:
 - A scene graph
 - An elegant and flexible animation API similar to that of UIKit
 - Touch detection on 3D objects
 - Built-in support for drawing sprites
 
The goal of GLKit++ is to give you functionality that most 3D applications today need that does not directly have anything todo with rendering. In fact, there is not a single OpenGL call in the core of the framework. This enables you to draw your 3D objects in any way you like and still get super sweet functionality like animation and touch detection.

Getting started
=============
The easiest way to get started is to look at the examples included in the repository. These show how you can accomplish common tasks like animating a 2D scene, creating custom 3D objects, touch detection and how to create an augmented reality app.
